# C++ Generic Functions and Classes

## Description
The code provided is intended to help students understand the concepts of what generic functions and classes look like in C++. In CSCC24, we have learned how to create generic functions and classes in Java, so equivalent functions and classes are provided to highlight the similarities and differences between coding in Java and C++. 

## Instructions on how to run the code

### Java files
Files to run:
- GenericFunctions.java
- [FILL IN CLASS FILES]
- Inheritence.java

 >###### *Note: make sure that Java JDK is installed. For instructions, consult https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/.

How to run:
- Open the terminal and navigate to the folder that the code is stored.
- Compile the Java code using the javac command. This will generate a .class file in the same directory as you .java file.
  - ```
    javac filename.java
    ```
- Run the java program using the java command.
  - ```
    java filename
    ```
- The output will appear in the terminal.

### C++ files
Files included are:
- Generic functions
  - GenericFunctionss.cpp
- Generic classes
  - [FILL IN]
- Inheritence
  - Inheritence.cpp
