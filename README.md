# C++ Generic Functions and Classes

## Description
The code provided is intended to help students understand the concepts of what generic functions and classes look like in C++. In CSCC24, we have learned how to create generic functions and classes in Java, so equivalent functions and classes are provided to highlight the similarities and differences between coding in Java and C++. 

## Instructions on how to run the code

For all files, please download them first before attempting to run them!

>###### *Note: Wherever it says filename, that means to replace with the name of the file intended to be run. For example, if you want to run TwoD.java, instead of typing javac filename.java, instead type javac TwoD.java

### Java files
Files to run:
- GenericFunctions.java
- TwoD.java
- Inheritence.java

For the Inheritence.java file, if you want to run this file, please also make sure the Animal.java, Cat.java, and Dog.java files are installed as well and placed in the same directory as the Inheritence.java file.

 >###### *Note: make sure that Java JDK is installed. For instructions, consult https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/.

How to run:
- Open the terminal and navigate to the folder that the code is stored.
- Compile the Java code using the javac command. This will generate a .class file in the same directory as you .java file.
```
>>> javac filename.java
```
- Run the java program using the java command.
```
>>> java filename
```
- The output will appear in the terminal.

### C++ files
Files to run:
- GenericFunctionss.cpp
- ClassEx1.cpp
- ClassEx2.cpp
- Inheritence.cpp

 >###### *Note: make sure that g++ version 11+ is installed (the latest version is 14.2.0). This is to ensure that we can use C++20 features. If this is not installed, download MinGW-W64-builds from https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/, and add mingw64 to your PATH. To check whether the right version is installed, on the terminal type "g++ --version"

How to run:
- Open the terminal and navigate to the folder that the code is stored.
- Compile the C++ code as follows:
```
>>> g++ -std=c++20 filename.cpp -o filename.exe
```
- Run the exe file.
```
>>> filename.exe
```
- The output will appear in the terminal.

## Modifications
To make modifications to the code, download a local copy to your device. Using an IDE (such as VS Code), you can edit and then recompile per the instructions above.
